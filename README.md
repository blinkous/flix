### Notes
Adding the images proved to be a bit difficult because they wouldn't render at first. First I changed the background color of the image to make sure that the space was there (they were). Then I cleaned the build and it didn't work. Then I made the table cell a little taller and it still didn't work. So I re-copied and pasted back the image baseUrls and re-ran it and it still didn't work. So I went to the API documentation and copied what they had there changing the image width in the baseUrl to "w500" and re-ran it before stepping away and voila, when I looked back, the images had rendered.
